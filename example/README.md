# Demo App
We are going to make a demo web app to clone the Carrier Native SDK shell demo app. The shell demo app is a command line app. You can run two shell app as two different users. They can talk to each other, adding/removing friends, steaming etc.

We are going to make the same app but in browser using this NodeJs SDK.
